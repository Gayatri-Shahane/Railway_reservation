<h1 align="centre">Railway Reservation System</h1>

The framework is a web – based application that permits guests to check transport accessibility, purchase and pay transport tickets on the web. The proposed train online reservation system was created utilizing Python for the front-end
and SQL for the backend database.
The aim of the project is to design and develop a database maintaining the records of different trains, train status, and passengers.
# Features - 
● Book the train tickets.<br>
● Check the details of trains and their status from their place itself as it avoids inconveniences of going to railway stations for each and every query they get.<br>
● Avail a valid E-Ticket for the travel.<br>
● Stores all the past travel tickets and transactions on their account.<br>
